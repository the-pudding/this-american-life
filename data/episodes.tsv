14	02	21	1996	Accidental Documentaries	"
What unites these stories on the surface is that they're all made from old tapes, recordings found in attics and thrift stores. What unites them under that surface — and not far under it — is that they all end up being stories about fathers and the legacies that fathers leave their children.

18	03	28	1996	Liars	"
April first is the one day of the year when we're allowed to enjoy deceiving others. But April Fools' Day is for amateur deceivers.

61	04	25	1997	Fiasco!	"
Stories of when things go wrong. Really wrong. When you leave the normal realm of human error, fumble, mishap, and mistake and enter the territory of really huge breakdowns. Fiascos.

68	07	04	1997	Lincoln's Second Inaugural	"
A show for July 4th weekend. We begin with perhaps the most moving, poetic inaugural speech in American history, and look at its legacy today. In his second inaugural address, Lincoln wondered aloud why God saw fit to send the slaughter of the Civil War to the United States. His conclusion: that slavery was a kind of original sin for the United States, for both North and South, and all Americans had to do penance for it.

70	07	25	1997	Other People's Mail	"

The interracial pair travel through the still mostly-segregated society and have very different opinions about what they see, especially when it comes to some distant relatives of Josh's in South Africa.

Stories of the first day on the job, the first day in a relationship, the first day in school.

121	01	29	1999	Twentieth Century Man	"
One thing that makes our country different from most others is this idea that you can re-create yourself as someone you'd prefer to be...sell everything off, head out west, start a new life.  But what happens if you're too good at it?  At throwing everything out and starting over?

133	06	25	1999	Sales	"
Consider for a moment all the art forms that began in America: jazz, the blues, musical theater, rock n' roll, phonograph recordings, television, motion pictures, video games. But the art form in which America leads the world—more than any other—is the art of selling. In this show: case examples to prove the point.

134	07	09	1999	We Didn't	"
Stories about what happens when we don't do something. It turns out that not falling in love, not doing our jobs, not spending time with our families is every bit as vivid and complicated an experience as doing something.

137	08	20	1999	The Book That Changed Your Life	"
Stories of people who believe a book changed their life. It's a romantic notion, and one reason we believe it is because we want to believe our lives can be changed by something so simple as an idea — or a set of ideas contained in a book.

139	09	03	1999	Ghosts of Elections Past	"
Stories of political idealists, stories designed to provide some small sense of hope about American politics. Most of these were first broadcast during the 1996 Presidential race. "	//hw2.thisamericanlife.org/sites/default/files/imagecache/large_square/photos/large/v139_lg.jpg	https://hw2.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/139
140	09	24	1999	Family Business	"
Stories of family businesses, and what happens when the tension of family dynamics collides with the pressure of capitalist market forces. "	//hw2.thisamericanlife.org/sites/default/files/imagecache/large_square/photos/large/h140_lg.jpg	https://hw2.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/140
141	10	01	1999	Invisible Worlds	"

142	10	15	1999	Barbara	"
We hear the story of one African-American single mother. Barbara Clinkscales recorded her family's life over the course of seven months for This American Life.

143	10	22	1999	Sentencing	"
We've all heard occasional news stories about how some of the drug laws enacted in the last 15 years may have gone too far. First time offenders get locked up for decades. Judges—even Republican appointees—say that mandatory minimum sentences prevent them from making fair rulings. But have sentences really gone too far?

144	11	05	1999	Where Words Fail	"
One reason we tell stories is to explain things to ourselves that cannot, in the end, always be explained. When someone we're close to dies, we struggle for a way to get our minds around the fact of their absence. And often—the stories we invent aren't quite up to the job. In this week's show, people struggle to invent words adequate to cope with death.

148	12	24	1999	The Angels Wanna Wear My Red Suit	"
A special Christmas edition of our show, with stories about Santa Claus—the many many different versions of Santa Claus.

149	01	14	2000	Bedside Diplomacy	"
In the hospital, we give up our normal schedule and sleep patterns; we give up our normal food and clothing; we're in a place that has its own rules and its own language and its own customs.

151	01	28	2000	Primary	"
Today's program is made all of stories from the New Hampshire primary. Voters want to find a candidate who inspires them. Candidates want to inspire. So where's the system failing? Why do most of us feel like the system doesn't produce anyone inspiring? We hear stories that answer why. We hear from voters who've found candidates they love. And we hear what those voters are seeing that the rest of us aren't.

156	03	31	2000	What Remains	"
Usually This American Life brings you stories of people in the middle of big experiences. But sometimes these moments of dramatic change are only half the story. The other half occurs after time passes and they return to revisit what happened, and who they were back when. Today's show is about what they find.

165	07	28	2000	Americans In Paris	"
Many Americans have dreamy and romantic ideas about Paris, notions which probably trace back to the 1920s vision of Paris created by the expatriate Americans there. But what's it actually like in Paris if you're an American, without rose-colored glasses?

168	09	15	2000	The Fix Is In	"
There are all sorts of situations in which we suspect the fix is in, but we almost never find out for certain. On today's show, for once, we find out. The whole program is devoted to one story, in which we go inside the back rooms of one multinational corporation and hear the intricate workings—recorded on tape—of how they put the fix in.

169	09	29	2000	Pursuit of Happiness	"
We as a nation declared our independence based on, among other things, the right to pursue our happiness.

We live in a big enough country that there are lots of laws too obscure for most of us to have heard of...but which actually affect tens of thousands of lives in huge ways. This show deals with one of them: A 1996 immigration law that the Immigration Service itself says is unfair.

176	01	26	2001	Two Nations, One President	"
In the wake of the 2001 election debacle in Florida, the two political halves of this country seemed angrier at each other than they had in decades. This week we bring you tales of that widening rift. Democrats explain why they're having trouble getting over it, and Republicans explain why this is so infuriating.

199	11	16	2001	House on Loon Lake	"
Our entire show this week is one long story, sort of a real-life Hardy Boys mystery. More than most of our shows, this one lends itself to a Hollywood-style tagline.

202	12	21	2001	Faith	"
Stories of faith: losing it, talking about it, constructing it, and working within it. "	//hw3.thisamericanlife.org/sites/default/files/imagecache/large_square/photos/large/h202_lg.jpg	https://hw2.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/202
203	01	11	2002	Recordings for Someone	"
All the stories in this week's show center on personal recordings that one person made for just one other person. "	//hw2.thisamericanlife.org/sites/default/files/imagecache/large_square/episodes/voicemail-th.jpg	https://hw2.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/203
204	01	18	2002	81 Words	"
The story of how the American Psychiatric Association decided in 1973 that homosexuality was no longer a mental illness. "	//hw3.thisamericanlife.org/sites/default/files/imagecache/large_square/episodes/204.jpg	https://hw2.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/204
205	02	01	2002	Plan B	"
There's the thing you plan to do, and then there's the thing you end up doing. Most of us start off our lives with some Plan A which we abandon...switching to a Plan B, which becomes our life. "	//hw1.thisamericanlife.org/sites/default/files/imagecache/large_square/photos/large/v205_lg.jpg	https://hw2.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/205
206	03	01	2002	Somewhere in the Arabian Sea	"
Life aboard the USS John C. Stennis, an aircraft carrier that was stationed in the Arabian Sea and supported bombing missions over Afghanistan. Only a few dozen people on board actually fly jets. It takes the rest of the crew — over 5,000 people — to keep them in the air. This American Life producers visited the Stennis in 2002, about six weeks into its deployment. The hour is devoted to this one story. "	//hw1.thisamericanlife.org/sites/default/files/imagecache/large_square/photos/large/h206_lg.jpg	https://hw2.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/206
207	03	08	2002	Special Ed	"
Stories about people who were told that they're different. Some of them were comfortable with it. Some didn't understand it. And some understood, but didn't like it. "	//hw1.thisamericanlife.org/sites/default/files/imagecache/large_square/photos/large/v207_lg.jpg	https://hw2.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/207
208	03	15	2002	Office Politics	"
Stories of high drama from our nation's workplaces. They turn out to be surprising, emotional places, with all the greed, jealousy, and ambition of real politics. "	//hw2.thisamericanlife.org/sites/default/files/imagecache/large_square/photos/large/h208_lg.jpg	https://hw2.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/208
209	03	29	2002	Didn't Ask to Be Born	"
Two stories that are worst case scenarios for any parent. In each story, when you take apart what happened and how it happened, it's hard to see how anyone could've prevented things from going bad. "	//hw3.thisamericanlife.org/sites/default/files/imagecache/large_square/photos/large/h209_lg.jpg	https://hw2.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/209
210	04	19	2002	Perfect Evidence	"
After a decade in which DNA evidence has freed over 100 people nationwide, it's become clear that DNA evidence isn't just proving wrongdoing by criminals, it's proving wrongdoing by police and prosecutors. In this show, we look at what DNA has revealed to us: how police get innocent people to confess to crimes they didn't commit and how they get witnesses to pin crimes on innocent people. "	//hw3.thisamericanlife.org/sites/default/files/imagecache/large_square/photos/large/h210_lg.jpg	https://hw2.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/210
211	05	03	2002	Naming Names	"
Stories about what happens when you name names. When you turn someone over to the authorities, it can set into motion lots of huge, unintended consequences. A reporter turns over an interviewee to the FBI. A group of teachers turn in their principal. A director turns in his Communist colleagues to the United States Congress. "	//hw2.thisamericanlife.org/sites/default/files/imagecache/large_square/photos/large/v211_lg.jpg	https://hw2.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/211
212	05	10	2002	The Other Man	"
Stories about what happens when a new guy comes on the scene, and changes the way everyone who was already there relates to each other. "	//hw3.thisamericanlife.org/sites/default/files/imagecache/large_square/photos/large/s212_lg.jpg	https://hw2.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/212
213	05	24	2002	Devil on My Shoulder	"
Stories of people who are trying to convince you that the Devil is there, whispering in your ear...and stories of people who try to deny he's there, against some very heavy evidence. "	//hw1.thisamericanlife.org/sites/default/files/imagecache/large_square/photos/large/v213_lg.jpg	https://hw2.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/213
214	05	31	2002	Family Physics	"
We take the stately laws of physics—laws which mathematicians and scientists have spent centuries discovering and verifying—and apply them to the realm of human relationships, to see if they shed useful light on our daily lives. "	//hw3.thisamericanlife.org/sites/default/files/imagecache/large_square/episodes/h214_lg_0.jpg	https://hw2.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/214
215	06	14	2002	Ask An Expert	"
Stories about people who turned to the experts and got horrible advice. One story is about people who went to therapists who made them sicker. Another is about how the hosts of Car Talk inadvertently (or perhaps intentionally) destroyed a car belonging to one of their own employees. "	//hw2.thisamericanlife.org/sites/default/files/imagecache/large_square/photos/large/h215_lg.jpg	https://hw2.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/215
216	07	12	2002	Give the People What They Want	"
Stories of people who go to great lengths to give people what they want, and how they're rewarded sometimes, misguided other times. "	//hw1.thisamericanlife.org/sites/default/files/imagecache/large_square/episodes/216.jpg	https://hw2.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/216
217	08	02	2002	Give It to Them	"
It's been two years since the Mideast peace process collapsed, two years in which each side has done terrible things to the other side. We wanted to understand what that has done to people living in Israel and the West Bank, and to see if anyone is feeling hope. "	//hw2.thisamericanlife.org/sites/default/files/imagecache/large_square/photos/large/h217_lg.jpg	https://hw2.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/217
218	08	09	2002	Act V	"
We devote this entire episode to one story: Over the course of six months, reporter and This American Life contributor Jack Hitt followed a group of inmates at a high-security prison as they rehearsed and staged a production of the last act—Act V—of Hamlet. "	//hw4.thisamericanlife.org/sites/default/files/imagecache/large_square/photos/large/h218_lg.jpg	https://hw2.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/218
219	08	16	2002	High Speed Chase	"
Stories of innocent people fleeing from dangerous men in cars who shoot at them. Unlike in the movies, the pursuers aren't foreign agents or rogue CIA agents, but drunk off-duty policemen and small-town teenagers. Real-ife high-speed chases: who gets chased...and who does the chasing.

220	08	30	2002	Testosterone	"
Stories of people getting more testosterone and coming to regret it. And of people losing it and coming to appreciate life without it. The pros and cons of the hormone of desire. "	//hw2.thisamericanlife.org/sites/default/files/imagecache/large_square/episodes/220-sm.jpg	https://hw2.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/220
221	09	20	2002	Fake I.D.	"
Stories of people traveling under fake papers, false identities, not for power or personal gain, but for their own deeper personal reasons. "	//hw1.thisamericanlife.org/sites/default/files/imagecache/large_square/photos/large/h221_lg.jpg	https://hw2.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/221
222	09	27	2002	Suckers	"
Some people have a rather dark worldview that divides people into two groups: Suckers and non-suckers. We hear their stories. "	//hw1.thisamericanlife.org/sites/default/files/imagecache/large_square/photos/large/v222_lg.jpg	https://hw2.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/222
223	10	11	2002	Classifieds	"
In this show we take the classifieds from one Sunday edition of the Chicago Sun-Times and one edition of the local alternative weekly Chicago Reader, and fill a program with stories that come from the ads. Through the jobs offered, the missed connections, the crap that people sell each other and the musicians' ads we get a portrait of a whole city.

224	10	25	2002	Middlemen	"
In this week's show, we celebrate the oft-beleaguered and misrepresented middleman. ""Cut out the middleman! Death to the middleman!"" the angry hordes cry. Not us. We say, ""Hi, middleman. Here are three splendid acts to toast your subtle virtues."" "	//hw4.thisamericanlife.org/sites/default/files/imagecache/large_square/photos/large/v224_lg.jpg	https://hw2.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/224
225	11	08	2002	Home Movies	"
Home movies are often all the same—kids on the beach, people getting married, birthday parties—so why do we make and watch so many of them? Maybe it's because the story they show and the story they tell are different. In this show, we bring you five stories that all start with a fairly typical home movie but go on to tell a unique story. "	//hw2.thisamericanlife.org/sites/default/files/imagecache/large_square/photos/large/h225_lg.jpg	https://hw2.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/225
226	12	06	2002	Reruns	"
Stories of people stuck in their own personal reruns—moments or episodes that they revisit over and over again.
You can watch an animated version of Robert Krulwich's Jackie O story from this episode. "	//hw3.thisamericanlife.org/sites/default/files/imagecache/large_square/photos/large/v226_lg.jpg	https://hw2.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/226

228	01	03	2003	You Are So Beautiful…To Me	"
Two stories about love, and what people mean when they use the word love. Or, looked at differently, two modern-day reinterpretations of the Frog Prince story. One concerns a pretty man falling in love with an unlikely woman. And an unlikely woman falling in love with a pretty bird.

In January 2002, the President of Afghanistan, Hamid Karzai, spoke at Georgetown University. There he urged Afghan-Americans, especially young ones, to move back to Afghanistan.

Stories of people trying to save the world one person at a time, and stories of sudden truths delivered by complete strangers. "	//hw4.thisamericanlife.org/sites/default/files/imagecache/large_square/photos/large/v231_lg.jpg	https://hw2.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/231
232	02	14	2003	The Real Story	"
It's been said that truth is the first casualty of war. In this week's show, we try to get the real stories from three very different wars. "	//hw1.thisamericanlife.org/sites/default/files/imagecache/large_square/photos/large/h232_lg.jpg	https://hw2.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/232

234	03	14	2003	Say Anything	"
Does talking about it really help? Stories where it does, and stories where it doesn't, including a man who tried to battle his fears by listing them. He ended up with a list 138 items long.

237	04	18	2003	Regime Change	"
Sure, John Kerry got in trouble for using the phrase, but we have no fear. Because we know that regime change, like charity, begins at home. This week: Stories of regime change in everyday life—people switching jobs, people switching families, businesses dying and new ones starting in their place.

238	05	30	2003	Lost in Translation	"
Stories of what can and cannot be translated. A short, non-athletic, bespectacled East Asian studies major who couldn't make his high school basketball team finds himself in the NBA as the personal translator for the first-ever Chinese pro basketball superstar, Yao Ming.

241	07	11	2003	20 Acts in 60 Minutes	"
Instead of the usual ""each week we choose a theme, and bring you 3 or 4 stories on that theme"" business, we throw all that away and bring you 20 stories—yes, 20—in 60 minutes.

243	07	25	2003	Later That Same Day	"
Stories about what the passage of time can do to someone. When each story starts, the world's aligned one way. Years pass—or sometimes just months—and everything's different.

244	08	15	2003	MacGyver	"
In real life, we usually never get to invent ingenious solutions, like the guy in the old TV series MacGyver. Today, four real stories in which real people invent amazingly clever solutions to their problems.

245	09	05	2003	Allure of the Mean Friend	"
What is it about them, our mean friends? They treat us badly, they don't call us back, they cancel plans at the last minute, and yet we come back for more. Popular bullies exist in business, politics, everywhere. How do they stay so popular?

What is this thing? This thing called love, that is. For answers, we explore the romance novel industry, a $1.5 billion empire run almost entirely by and for women. Plus, relearning the rules of romance from the other side of the gender line. And Sarah Vowell tells the story of the Greatest Romance of the 20th Century.

248	10	24	2003	Like It or Not	"
Some stories we make happen, others happen to us. Extremes from the latter category, where people let things happen to them and don't act, even when maybe they should. David Rakoff guest hosts.

249	10	31	2003	Garbage	"
We make what's usually invisible, visible: the world of trash. We follow the trash from the sanitation men on the street, to the mob guys who controlled the hauling business, to the people who actually live in dumps.

Biblical fables ripped from today's headlines. In his ongoing effort to write his own version of the Bible, Jonathan Goldstein retells the story of Cain and Abel. Finally we hear Cain's side of the story. Plus: neighbors in a small town in Illinois wonder if they could have stepped in—as their neighbors' keepers—to prevent a brutal triple murder.

253	12	05	2003	The Middle of Nowhere	"
Stories from faraway, hard-to-get-to places, where all rules are off, nefarious things happen because no one's looking, and there's no one to appeal to.

257	01	16	2004	What I Should've Said	"
People return to the scene of the crime where they should have spoken clearly, plainly, forcefully...to review what the hell went wrong, and in a few cases, to fix it. Jonathan Goldstein tries to stop time. Charles Monroe tries to figure out how to teach a lesson to the President of the United States.

258	01	30	2004	Leaving the Fold	"
A popular, progressive politician becomes...a talk show host. One you've probably heard of. A group of nuns leave the Catholic Church...only to find themselves essentially, remaining nuns. These and other stories of people leaving the situation they're used to—and striking off for something less familiar.

259	02	20	2004	Promised Land	"
For millennia, people have tried to reach a spiritual promised land by fasting. Jesus did it. Buddha did it. Monks and saints and new age gurus have done it. And, for for this episode, the late David Rakoff tried it. He did a 20-day fast, to find out if it would bring him any form of enlightenment. Also, contributor Starlee Kine tells a story about getting as close to one promised land as you possibly can, without actually going in.

260	03	12	2004	The Facts Don't Matter	"
There's what happened, and there's the story that gets told about what happened. Sometimes the two things don't match up very well. This week, two case examples—ripped, as they say, from today's headlines—of the story that's told becoming the truth, even though the facts don't back it up.

The U.S. government spent two years on a sting operation trapping an Indian man named Hemant Lakhani, whom they suspected of being an illegal arms dealer.

In the end, they got Lakhani, red-handed, delivering a missile to a terrorist in New Jersey. The only problem was, nothing in the sting was what it appeared to be. Including the missile.

Nine radio producers. Two days. One rest stop on the New York State Thruway.

This week, we bring you a deeper look inside the health insurance industry. The dark side of prescription drug coupons. A story about Pet Health Insurance, which is in its infancy, and how it is changing human behaviors—for example, if you have the pet health insurance, you bring your pet to the vet more often, and the vet makes more money and...well, you can see the parallels.

396	12	18	2009	#1 Party School	"
In 2009, The Princeton Review named Penn State the #1 Party School in America. It's a rotating crown—last year it was University of Florida, before that it was West Virginia University.

397	01	01	2010	2010	"
At the start of a new year, journalistic outfits put out lots of mealy ""perhaps oil prices will rise or perhaps they won't"" predictions for the coming year.

400	02	12	2010	Stories Pitched by Our Parents	"
For our 400th show, we try something harder than anything we've ever tried in the previous 399.

403	03	26	2010	NUMMI	"
A car plant in Fremont California that might have saved the U.S. car industry. In 1984, General Motors and Toyota opened NUMMI as a joint venture.

Frank Langfitt explains why GM didn't learn the lessons—until it was too late.

Unprecedented amounts of money have been pledged to Haitian relief in the last few months. American households have given over $1 billion and in March, 120 countries pledged over $9 billion(!) to rebuild. The only problem is that—historically—blanketing a country in aid and money has never really worked so well. Is there a chance this time things could be different?

410	06	18	2010	Social Contract	"
Richard Ravitch has helped fix three governmental crises, including when New York City nearly went bankrupt in 1975.

In the 1970s a reporter named Charles Salter wrote a column for the Atlanta Journal called ""Georgia Rambler.""

415	09	24	2010	Crybabies	"

really effective tactic. We have stories of crybabies in sports, in politics, on Wall Street, on the streets of California, including a new story by David Sedaris.

417	10	29	2010	This Party Sucks	"
A show for this year's midterm elections. Two best friends in Michigan, both political novices, get tired of yelling at their TVs and take matters into their own hands.

418	11	05	2010	Toxie	"
In January 2010, reporters from Planet Money bought a toxic asset—you know, the things that blew up wall street banks, sank the economy and brought the global financial system to a halt—one of those. And ""Toxie"" turned out to be an encyclopedia of the financial crisis. Here's an animation about Toxie. And here's an interactive timeline tracking its value.

424	01	14	2011	Kid Politics	"
What if, say, the U.S.-led invasion of Grenada in 1983 had been decided, not by Ronald Reagan, but by a bunch of middle-schoolers?

This week, stories about whether, when it comes to governing, kids do any better than grown-ups.

425	01	21	2011	Slow To React	"
This week we have stories where people's reactions move very slowly, including the story of a wedding 17 years in the making, and what it's like
when you have a terminal illness that's supposed to kill you in a year or two, and it decides to take its time.

427	02	11	2011	Original Recipe	"
The formula for Coca-Cola is one of the most jealously guarded trade secrets in the world. Locked in a vault in Atlanta. Supposedly unreplicable. But we think we may have found the original recipe. And to see if the formula actually might be Coke, we made a batch. Or, anyway, we asked the folks at Jones Soda and Sovereign Flavors to whip up some up, to see if it tastes like Coke. The recipe is here. "	//hw3.thisamericanlife.org/sites/default/files/imagecache/large_square/episodes/v427.jpg	https://hw2.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/427

This week: A drug court program that we believe is run differently from every other drug court in the country, doing some things that are contrary to the very philosophy of drug court. The result?

This week we're trying something we've never tried before: An hour of stories about...this week. We take a crack at major news events, like what's happening in Egypt; and at the most minor, like an 8-year-old who's finally taking the training wheels off her bike.

435	05	13	2011	How To Create a Job	"
It seems like every politician has a plan for putting people back to work. But we and the Planet Money team couldn’t help but wonder…how do you create a job? Can politicians truly create many jobs?

Yes yes yes you've heard it all before, when it comes to stories of fathers and their children. There's the story of the kid who idolizes his dad, but then learns something and becomes disappointed. Or the opposite story, where the kid gives up on his dad when he's still young, and then much later comes to have a grudging respect. This week for fathers day: surprising stories of fathers trying to be good dads.

A professor in Pennsylvania makes a calculation, to discover that his state is sitting atop a massive reserve of
natural gas—enough to revolutionize how America gets its energy.

Two men, two calculations, and two very different consequences. (Transcript)

Why would a company rent an office in a tiny town in East Texas, put a nameplate on the door, and leave it completely empty for a year? The answer involves a controversial billionaire physicist in Seattle, a 40 pound cookbook, and a war waging right now, all across the software and tech industries. (Transcript)

442	07	29	2011	Thugs	"
Like a lot of Mexican towns, Florencia has had its share of problems dealing with drug gangs. That is until recently, when new narcos rolled into
town telling residents that they were there to liberate them. They promised that people would live in peace and tranquility. And so far, it's working. As long as the narcos are on the streets with guns, people feel safe. That and other stories of thugs.

We head to some of the happiest places on Earth: Amusement Parks!

444	08	26	2011	Gossip	"
This week, Sarah Koenig hosts, as we tackle the thing we all hate to love: Gossip. That's right; we've got rumor, we've got innuendo, and we've got a story of gossipers gone pro. Sarah even makes a compelling case that in some places, gossip could very well be saving lives. But you didn't hear it from us.

445	09	09	2011	Ten Years In	"
In this show, we return to people who've been on This American Life in the last ten years, whose lives were drastically altered by 9/11, including Hyder Akbar, an Afghan-American teen who moved to Afghanistan after his father was tapped to become governor of Kunar province there.

447	09	23	2011	The Incredible Case of the P.I. Moms	"
What do you get when you take a private investigation firm, toss in a bunch of sexy soccer moms, then add official sponsorship from Glock firearms, a lying boss, and delusions of grandeur? This week's show. That's what you get.
Pete Crooks' original article and book about the P.I. Moms. "	//hw4.thisamericanlife.org/sites/default/files/imagecache/large_square/episodes/447_lg.jpg	https://hw2.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/447
448	10	07	2011	Adventure!	"
Sometimes you choose the adventure and sometimes the adventure chooses you. This week, stories that pinpoint when people's boring old lives turn into something wildly unfamiliar. Including a story of one young man's time served in a Chinese prison, and a handful of adventure stories from some of our favorite writers.

449	10	28	2011	Middle School	"
This week, at the suggestion of a 14-year-old listener, we bring you stories from the awkward, confusing, hormonally charged world of middle school. Including a teacher who transforms peer pressure into a force for good, and reports from the frontlines of the middle school dance.
(Pictured: 7th graders at a costume dance, dressed as characters from The Outsiders.) "	//hw2.thisamericanlife.org/sites/default/files/imagecache/large_square/episodes/449_lg_0.jpg	https://hw2.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/449
450	11	11	2011	So Crazy It Just Might Work	"
A few years ago a cancer researcher named Jonathan Brody gave a speech at his alma mater saying that people in his field really needed to think outside the box to find a cure. Afterward he was approached by his old orchestra teacher, who had something way out of the box—a theory that he could kill cancer cells with electromagnetic waves. And other stories.

451	11	18	2011	Back to Penn State	"
In the wake of the recent news, listeners have contacted us and tweeted about the show we did two years ago at Penn State, #1 Party School. We listen again to some of those stories, with new interviews recorded this past week, as Penn State fans and loyalists try to make sense of the actions of Coach Joe Paterno and school officials.

453	12	16	2011	Nemeses	"
This week, stories where a longtime standoff keeps both sides coming back for more. Including a story about the time in Poland's recent history where the country's two political blocks came together and believed, however briefly, they'd be able to set aside their differences. And another story about a college rivalry gone viral, and personal.

454	01	06	2012	Mr. Daisey and the Apple Factory	"
NOTE: This American Life has retracted this story because we learned that many of Mike Daisey's experiences in China were fabricated. "	//hw4.thisamericanlife.org/sites/default/files/imagecache/large_square/episodes/454_lg.jpg	https://hw2.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/454
455	01	20	2012	Continental Breakup	"
If you're like us, when the words ""European debt crisis"" pop up in the news you feel a little worried, and a little like taking a nap. Turns out, there's a story behind this story. One that's filled with guilt, and drama, and betrayal, and 100-year-old dreams come true. Alex Blumberg of Planet Money guest hosts.

456	01	27	2012	Reap What You Sow	"
Alabama's new immigration law aims to make life so difficult for illegal immigrants that they will ""self-deport."" And in a way it's working. Immigrants are fleeing Alabama...but not just the undocumented ones. This and other stories of people living with the unintended consequences of their decisions.

457	02	10	2012	What I Did For Love	"
Love makes us do crazy things. But not this crazy. This week for Valentine's Day we have stories of people going to extremes as they fall in love, chase love down, and try to make sense of it—including a teenager who falls for an undercover cop, and epic tales of snooping. "	//hw3.thisamericanlife.org/sites/default/files/imagecache/large_square/episodes/457-sm.jpg	https://hw2.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/457
458	02	17	2012	Play the Part	"
Stories of people who decide to flip their personalities and do the exact opposite of what they normally do. Pictured: Louis Ortiz, Obama impersonator.

459	03	02	2012	What Kind of Country	"
All across the country right now, local and state governments are finding they can't pay their bills. Schools are losing teachers, street lights are going dark, garbage is piling up in public parks, and cops are suddenly an optional expense.

460	03	16	2012	Retraction	"
We've discovered that one of our most popular episodes contained numerous fabrications. This week, we detail the errors in Mike Daisey's story about visiting Foxconn, which makes iPads and other products for Apple in China. Marketplace's China correspondent Rob Schmitz discovered the fabrications. Transcript. Press Release.

461	03	30	2012	Take the Money and Run for Office	"
For anyone who has ever heard the term ""Washington insider"" and felt outside — we are with you. So this week, we go inside the rooms where the deals get made, to the actual moment that the checks change hands — and we ask the people writing and receiving the checks what, exactly, is the money buying?

462	04	13	2012	Own Worst Enemy	"

463	04	27	2012	Mortal Vs. Venial	"
Religion makes it pretty clear what differentiates mortal sins from venial ones. Mortal are the really bad sins and venial the lesser ones. But in our everyday lives, it can be really difficult to determine just how bad we've been. This week we have stories of people trying to figure out that question.

464	05	18	2012	Invisible Made Visible	"
The radio version of an episode we did live on stage and beamed to movie theaters. David Sedaris, Tig Notaro, Ryan Knighton, and the late David Rakoff, in his final performance on the show.
The other half of this two-hour show was visual, including dancers, animation, and more. You can download video of the entire show. "	//hw4.thisamericanlife.org/sites/default/files/imagecache/large_square/episodes/464_lg_2.jpg	https://hw2.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/464
465	05	25	2012	What Happened At Dos Erres	"
In 1982, the Guatemalan military massacred the villagers of Dos Erres, killing more than 200 people. Thirty years later, a Guatemalan living in the US got a phone call from a woman who told him that two boys had been abducted during the massacre — and he was one of them.

466	06	08	2012	Blackjack	"
Stories about the casino game everyone thinks they can beat. In one, a woman gambles away her inheritance and then sues the casino, saying they're to blame. In another, Christians join forces to take down casinos — by becoming professional card-counting blackjack players. Plus: MIT Blackjack Team member Andy Bloch teaches us to count cards.

467	06	22	2012	Americans in China	"
It used to be that the American expats in China were the big shots. They had the money, the status, the know-how. But that's changed. What's it like to be an American living in China now? And what do they understand about China that we don't?

468	06	29	2012	Switcheroo	"
People pretending to be people they're not: sometimes it's harmless, sometimes it's harmful, and sometimes it's hard to tell. From world-famous artists to mail-order brides to a practice that could change the face of American journalism. "	//hw3.thisamericanlife.org/sites/default/files/imagecache/large_square/episodes/468_lg_0.jpg	https://hw2.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/468
469	07	13	2012	Hiding in Plain Sight	"
Sometimes when something is happening right under your nose, it becomes even harder to notice than if it were happening in secret. Stories of people of using that to their advantage, including one man who takes down some of the most powerful criminals in the world. "	//hw2.thisamericanlife.org/sites/default/files/imagecache/large_square/episodes/469-sq.jpg	https://hw2.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/469
470	07	27	2012	Show Me the Way	"
Stories about people in trouble, who look for help in mystifying places. A 15-year-old boy travels more than 1,000 miles, alone, to seek out his hero, whom he's never met. And from the archive of Wiretap, Jonathan Goldstein and David Rakoff tell the story of a man with a terrible medical problem, hoping for a cure from a famous doctor — who only communicates in rhyme.

471	08	10	2012	The Convert	"
In 2006, a new convert showed up at a mosque in Orange County, California, eager to study the Koran and make new friends. But when he started acting odd and saying strange things, those friends got suspicious. To them, he was Farouk al-Aziz. But his real name was Craig Monteilh, and he was working undercover for the FBI. (Read the update to this story here.)

Only the clever need apply. This week, stories of people acting on a
technicality in the face of some of life's toughest regulators: financial
regulators, parents and God. "	//hw4.thisamericanlife.org/sites/default/files/imagecache/large_square/episodes/473_lg.jpg	https://hw2.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/473
474	09	14	2012	Back to School	"
As kids and teachers head back to school, we wanted to turn away from questions about politics and unions and money and all the regular school stuff people argue about, and turn to something more optimistic — an emerging theory about what to teach kids, from Paul Tough's book How Children Succeed.

475	09	28	2012	Send a Message	"
This week people reach out in all kinds of ways to try to get their point
across. And the recipients of those messages try to decipher what
they mean. Messages in code, over the phone, and from beyond the grave. "	//hw2.thisamericanlife.org/sites/default/files/imagecache/large_square/episodes/475_lg_0.jpg	https://hw2.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/475
476	10	05	2012	What Doesn’t Kill You	"
Stories of how people cope after brushes with death. Sometimes death comes as a disease. Sometimes it swims up and bites you. And sometimes it's a pen or pencil, sitting there, just waiting for you to ingest it.
Tig Notaro's comedy set is at Louis CK's site. "	//hw3.thisamericanlife.org/sites/default/files/imagecache/large_square/episodes/476_lg.jpg	https://hw2.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/476
477	10	19	2012	Getting Away With It	"
Stories of people breaking the rules fully, completely
and with no bad consequences. Some justify this by saying they’re doing it
for others, or for a greater good. Some really don’t care. And, unlike the
mealy weaklings you usually hear on this program: None of these wrongdoers
seem regretful about what they’ve done in the slightest. "	//hw1.thisamericanlife.org/sites/default/files/imagecache/large_square/episodes/477_lg.jpg	https://hw2.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/477
478	11	02	2012	Red State Blue State	"
Everyone knows that politics is now so divided in our country that not only do the two sides disagree on the solutions to the country’s problems, they don’t even agree on what the problems are. It’s two versions of the world in collision. This week we hear from people who’ve seen this infect their personal lives.

479	11	23	2012	Little War on the Prairie	"
Growing up in Mankato, Minnesota, John Biewen says, nobody ever talked about the most important historical event ever to happen there: in 1862, it was the site of the largest mass execution in U.S. history. Thirty-eight Dakota Indians were hanged after a war with white settlers. John went back to Minnesota to figure out what really happened 150 years ago, and why Minnesotans didn’t talk about it much after.

480	11	30	2012	Animal Sacrifice	"
What animals sacrifice for us, and what we sacrifice for them. Including a story from Susan Orlean about dogs in World War II, and the This American Life staff confronts Ira about his dog, Piney.

481	12	07	2012	This Week	"
This week we take on ... this week. Stories united
by one thing: They all happened in the seven days prior to broadcast. We
try our hand reporting the global stories in Egypt and Afghanistan; and
take on super local stories, too, like a man who tries valiantly —
valiantly! — to actually get out of bed when his alarm clock goes off. You can also see this week in pictures.

483	01	04	2013	Self-Improvement Kick 	"
A perfectly normal guy gets rid of everything he owns, changes his name, says goodbye to his friends — and begins walking. In the name of peace. And Honduran government officials try to heal their corrupt country by starting a perfect city, from scratch. For the new year, we bring you stories about how far some people go in hopes of a better life.

484	01	11	2013	Doppelgängers	"
We got a tip about a meat plant selling pig intestines as fake calamari, wondered if it could be true, and decided to investigate. Doppelgängers, doubles, evil twins and not-so-evil twins, this week. Fred Armisen co-hosts with Ira Glass.
EXTRAS: Fred's Ira impression on SNL. Pig/squid shirts. And prints. "	//hw2.thisamericanlife.org/sites/default/files/imagecache/large_square/episodes/484.jpg	https://hw2.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/484
485	01	25	2013	Surrogates	"
This week we look at people who see themselves in others and try to live out their lives through stand-ins — including the story of what one father saw in the convicted murderer he decided to adopt. And the proxy battle over a woman’s honor that became a presidential obsession.

487	02	15	2013	Harper High School, Part One	"
We spent five months at Harper High School in Chicago, where last year alone 29 current and recent students were shot. 29. We went to get a sense of what it means to live in the midst of all this gun violence, how teens and adults navigate a world of funerals and Homecoming dances. We found so many incredible and surprising stories, this show is a two-parter; you can listen to Part Two here.

489	03	01	2013	No Coincidence, No Story!	"
We asked listeners to send us their best coincidence stories, and we got more than 1,300 submissions! There were so many good ones we decided to make a whole show about them. From a chance encounter at a bus station to a romantic dollar bill to a baffling apparition in a college shower stall. See more of your coincidence stories — with photos — here.

490	03	22	2013	Trends With Benefits	"
The number of Americans receiving federal disability payments has nearly doubled over the last 15 years. There are towns and counties around the nation where almost 1/4 of adults are on disability. Planet Money's Chana Joffe-Walt spent 6 months exploring the disability program, and emerges with a story of the U.S. economy quite different than the one we've been hearing. Web Extra: here.

491	03	29	2013	Tribes	"
A Native American tribe is doing exactly the opposite of what you'd think they'd do: they're kicking people out of the tribe, huge numbers of them, including people whose ancestors without question were part of the tribe. And the story of a white guy who only wants to date Asian women, who then has to adjust to the reality of a real actual Asian woman in his life. The phrase ""finding your tribe"" is a total cliche — but one that does apply to certain situations.

Dr. Benjamin Gilmer (left) gets a job at a rural clinic. He finds out he’s replaced someone — also named Dr. Gilmer (picture) — who went to prison after killing his own father. But the more Benjamin’s patients talk about the other Dr. Gilmer, the more confused he becomes. Everyone loved the old Dr. Gilmer. So Benjamin starts digging around, trying to understand how a good man can seemingly turn bad.

494	05	03	2013	Hit the Road	"
We're opening windows and going places. This week we have stories of people who, for reasons that they can't always explain, feel compelled to get out and go somewhere. Including the story of one man who decides to take a trip from Philadelphia to San Francisco — by foot.

495	05	17	2013	Hot In My Backyard	"
After years of being stuck, the national conversation on climate change finally started to shift — just a little — last year, the hottest year on record in the U.S., with Hurricane Sandy flooding the New York subway, drought devastating Midwest farms, and California and Colorado on fire. Lots of people were wondering if global warming had finally arrived, here at home. This week, stories about this new reality.

496	05	31	2013	When Patents Attack... Part Two!	"
Two years ago, we did a program about a mysterious business in Texas that threatens companies
with lawsuits for violating its patents. But the world of patent lawsuits is so secretive, there were
basic questions we could not answer. Now we can. And we get a glimpse why people say our
patent system may be discouraging, not encouraging, innovation. "	//hw2.thisamericanlife.org/sites/default/files/imagecache/large_square/episodes/496_lg2.jpg	https://hw2.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/496
497	06	14	2013	This Week	"
This week we return to one of our favorite themes: This Week! All of the stories in the show are things that have taken place in the last seven days. We've got our own take on the big, national stories of the week but we also turn a searchlight across America and find the smaller, more personal and more spectacular stories that most of us never hear.

498	06	21	2013	The One Thing You're Not Supposed To Do	"
This week, stories about people who know something's a bad idea,
but convince themselves to do that thing anyway. Including the story of a bunch of illegal
immigrants who turn themselves in to the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, hoping to
be sent into detention. "	//hw4.thisamericanlife.org/sites/default/files/imagecache/large_square/episodes/498_lg.jpg	https://hw2.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/498
499	06	28	2013	Taking Names	"
The truly incredible story of a guy named Kirk Johnson who started a list of hundreds of Iraqis who needed to get out of their country. They were getting death threats, and he was their only hope. Only 26 and living in his aunt's basement, he had no idea what to do. How Kirk kind of succeeded spectacularly and failed spectacularly at the same time.

500	07	12	2013	500!	"
To celebrate our 500th episode, Ira asked the producers of This American Life to talk about their very favorite moments on the show. Some chose stories that've been more or less forgotten for years; others chose just one line of script, or a segment that secretly made them cry. So for our 500th, we bring you the best of This American Life — the way we've been hearing it, behind the scenes, all these years.

501	07	26	2013	The View From In Here	"
It's so easy to lose perspective (or worry you've lost perspective) when you're deep inside some situation. For instance, an American woman who suddenly trades her life for one in a place most people might think twice about: Juarez, Mexico. "	//hw4.thisamericanlife.org/sites/default/files/imagecache/large_square/episodes/501_lg.jpg	https://hw2.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/501
502	08	09	2013	This Call May Be Recorded... To Save Your Life	"
A journalist named Meron Estefanos gets a disturbing tip. She's given a phone number that supposedly belongs to a group of refugees being held hostage in the Sinai desert. She dials the number, and soon dozens of strangers are begging her to rescue them. How can she ignore them? "	//hw4.thisamericanlife.org/sites/default/files/imagecache/large_square/episodes/452_lg_0.jpg	https://hw2.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/502
503	08	16	2013	I Was Just Trying To Help	"
Stories of people doing the noble thing and stepping up to help, only to find out that others think what they're doing isn't helping at all. Planet Money looks at a charity that's decided to just give people money, and a sheriff in California devises a plan to let farmers grow weed — as long as they register with him.

504	09	06	2013	How I Got Into College	"
Students all over are starting college this month, and some of them still have a nagging question: what, exactly, got me in? An admissions officer tells us the most wrongheaded things applicants try. And Michael Lewis has the incredible story of how a stolen library book got one man — Emir Kamenica — into his dream school.

505	09	20	2013	Use Only as Directed	"
One of the country's most popular over-the-counter painkillers — acetaminophen, the active ingredient in Tylenol — also kills the most people, according to data from the federal government. Over 150 Americans die each year on average after accidentally taking too much. And it requires a lot less to endanger you than you may know. We reported this alongside ProPublica. Their stories here and here. "	//hw3.thisamericanlife.org/sites/default/files/imagecache/large_square/episodes/graph_inUS.jpg	https://hw2.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/505
506	10	04	2013	Secret Identity	"
A bank robber on an undercover mission. A teenage girl with the powers of a tiger. A vigilante seeking vengeance in Ciudad Juarez. All have secret identities. But not all of them chose those identities for themselves.

507	10	11	2013	Confessions	"
Two crime scenes, two murders. One crime is solved, the other case went cold. Both raise the question: What should a person suspected of murder say?

508	10	18	2013	Superpowers 2013	"
This is an updated version of a classic episode, featuring a new story from Snap Judgment.

We answer the following questions about superpowers: Can superheroes be real people? (No.) Can real people become superheroes? (Maybe.) And which is better: flight or invisibility? (Depends who you ask.)

Chris ware's comic mentioned in the episode is here.

509	10	25	2013	It Says So Right Here	"
Everyone knows you can't always believe what you read, but sometimes even official documents aren't a path to the truth. This week we have stories of people whose lives are altered when seemingly boring documents like birth certificates and petitions are used against them. And a family wrestles with a medical record that has a very clear, but complicated diagnosis. "	//hw4.thisamericanlife.org/sites/default/files/imagecache/large_square/episodes/509_lg2.jpg	https://hw2.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/509
510	11	01	2013	Fiasco!	"
Stories of when things go wrong. Really wrong. When you leave the normal realm of human error, fumble, mishap, and mistake and enter the territory of really huge breakdowns. Fiascos. Things go so awry that normal social order collapses. An updated version of a classic episode, now including one of the most popular stories we've ever aired... about a police officer and a squirrel.

511	11	08	2013	The Seven Things You’re Not Supposed to Talk About	"
Producer Sarah Koenig's mother lives by a set of rules about conversation. She has an actual list of off-limits topics, including how you slept, your period, your health, your diet and more. You don't talk about these things, she says, because nobody cares. This week we try to find stories on these exact topics that will prove her wrong. "	//hw3.thisamericanlife.org/sites/default/files/imagecache/large_square/episodes/511_lg.jpg	https://hw2.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/511
512	11	22	2013	House Rules	"
Where you live is important. It can dictate quality of schools and hospitals, as well as things like cancer rates, unemployment, or whether the city repairs roads in your neighborhood. On this week's show, stories about destiny by address.


Much of this story is told to Nancy Updike by ProPublica reporter Nikole Hannah-Jones, whose series on the Fair Housing laws — with more stories, research and interviews — is here.

513	12	13	2013	129 Cars	"
We spend a month at a Jeep dealership on Long Island as they try to make their monthly sales goal: 129 cars. If they make it, they'll get a huge bonus from the manufacturer, possibly as high as $85,000 — enough to put them in the black for the month. If they don't make it, it'll be the second month in a row. So they pull out all the stops. Photo gallery here. NOTE: the Internet version of this episode includes un-bleeped curse words. Bleeped version here. "	//hw4.thisamericanlife.org/sites/default/files/imagecache/large_square/episodes/513.jpg	https://hw2.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/513
514	12	20	2013	Thought That Counts	"
It's the thought that counts. So true. Unfortunately, sometimes it's not always so clear what that thought was. And sometimes, when it is clear, we wish it wasn't. This week, during this, the season of giving, we turn our spotlight on the givers and exactly whatever it was they could've possibly been thinking. "	//hw4.thisamericanlife.org/sites/default/files/imagecache/large_square/episodes/514.jpg	https://hw2.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/514
515	01	10	2014	Good Guys	"
Yes fellas, lots of you think of yourselves as good guys. But what does it really take to be a good guy? We have stories of valiant men attempting to do good in challenging circumstances: in war zones, department stores, public buses, and at the bottom of a cave 900 feet underground. "	//hw2.thisamericanlife.org/sites/default/files/imagecache/large_square/episodes/515_lg.jpg	https://hw2.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/515
516	01	17	2014	Stuck In The Middle	"
Jan Brady is not the only one who hated being in the middle. This week we have stories about how it sucks to be in limbo or be the mediator, but we also hear from a man who absolutely loves being in that uncertain and boring middle most of us dread — on hold, listening to hold music. "	//hw3.thisamericanlife.org/sites/default/files/imagecache/large_square/episodes/516_lg.jpg	https://hw2.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/516
517	01	31	2014	Day At The Beach	"
It's January, and freezing outside. This week 5 stories from the sunny beach! Including David Sedaris telling us how losing a sister in 2013 prompted a family reunion, and an impulse buy of a lifetime — an oceanfront cottage big enough for all of them. "	//hw2.thisamericanlife.org/sites/default/files/imagecache/large_square/episodes/517_lg.jpg	https://hw2.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/517
518	02	14	2014	Except For That One Thing	"
Mike Anderson was 36 years old, married, a suburban father of four. He owned a contracting business and built his family’s modest, three-bedroom house in St. Louis from the ground up. He volunteered at church on the weekends and coaches his son’s football team. All pretty normal, right? Except for one thing … which surfaced one day two summers ago.

519	03	07	2014	Dead Men Tell No Tales	"
Last May, a weird story made the news: the FBI killed a guy in Florida who was loosely linked to the Boston Marathon bombings. He was shot seven times in his living room by a federal agent. What really happened? Why was the FBI even in that room with him? A reporter spent six months looking into it, and she found that the FBI was doing a bunch of things that never made the news. Her Boston Magazine story. "	//hw1.thisamericanlife.org/sites/default/files/imagecache/large_square/episodes/519_lg.jpg	https://hw2.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/519
520	03	14	2014	No Place Like Home	"
There are lots of ways we define where we're from. And whether we're proud of it, or ashamed of it, love it, hate it, miss it or are trying desperately to get back to it — where we're from is always a big part of who we are. This week, stories of people who are, in good ways and bad ways, coming to terms with the places they call home. (Beeped version) "	//hw3.thisamericanlife.org/sites/default/files/imagecache/large_square/episodes/520_lg2.jpg	https://hw2.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/520
521	03	28	2014	Bad Baby	"
They're small. And they're cuddly. But sometimes it feels as though our babies were replaced with demon replicas—controlling, demanding, or just downright awful. This week, stories of infants and children who dominate the adults around them with their baditude, or whom adults have painted with the ""bad"" brush from early on. We also ask the question: at what age does badness begin? "	//hw4.thisamericanlife.org/sites/default/files/imagecache/large_square/episodes/521_lg.jpg	https://hw2.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/521
522	04	11	2014	Tarred and Feathered	"
This week, stories of people being threatened and punished with public shame. Including the story of someone who was literally tarred and feathered. It happened a lot more recently than you'd guess. "	//hw3.thisamericanlife.org/sites/default/files/imagecache/large_square/episodes/tarred-feathered-th.jpg	https://hw2.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/522
523	04	25	2014	Death and Taxes	"
It is a peculiar feeling to know with certainty that something big is about to happen to you. This week we watch people go right up to the edge of inevitable change. We hear from preteens about the terrifying knowledge that puberty is about to happen...any minute now. And true to the death and taxes saying, we found it unavoidable to include a story about each one of those things. "	//hw3.thisamericanlife.org/sites/default/files/imagecache/large_square/episodes/523_2_lg_1.jpg	https://hw2.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/523
524	05	02	2014	I Was So High	"
Your waitress. Your colleagues at work. Your doctor. Maybe even your parents. They’re all high. All the time. That’s what it feels like anyway. This week, stories in which drug use and daily life intersect – and in which people get high in secret and then do their best to function in the non-high world. Also, we hear some “I Was So High” stories from our very own listeners.

525	05	09	2014	Call For Help	"
Stories of people coming to terms with being in serious trouble. They need help. Figuring out how to get it, that's another problem. "	//hw4.thisamericanlife.org/sites/default/files/imagecache/large_square/episodes/525_lg.jpg	https://hw2.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/525
526	05	23	2014	Is That What I Look Like?	"
You've been seeing yourself, getting to know what you look like, your whole life. So why does it often take an outsider to see things about you that are obvious, and set you straight?

527	06	13	2014	180 Degrees	"
Flipflops, u-turns, changes of heart, about faces. Completely changing our position — sometimes it can be our best move, sometimes it can be our worst. Either way, it's usually complicated. This week we bring you stories of people who go one way, and then, for what ever reason, turn around and go the exact opposite direction.

528	06	20	2014	The Radio Drama Episode 	"
Our most ambitious live show ever! (get the video!) We pulled together a massive team of theater pros at the Brooklyn Academy of Music's Opera House – nearly 50 singers, actors, dancers and musicians. The result? Journalism turned into a Broadway musical (the cast album is here), into opera. Mike Birbiglia, Sasheer Zamata, Stephin Merritt, Josh Hamilton, Lindsay Mendez, Lin-Manuel Miranda and others.

529	06	27	2014	Human Spectacle	"
Gladiators in the Colosseum. Sideshow performers. Reality television. We've always loved to gawk at the misery or majesty of others. But this week, we ask the question: What's it like when the tables are turned and all eyes are on you? "	//hw4.thisamericanlife.org/sites/default/files/imagecache/large_square/episodes/529_lg.jpg	https://hw2.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/529
530	07	18	2014	Mind Your Own Business	"
Stories of meddling, snooping, and just getting way, way up in other
people's business. A cellphone hidden in a bag of chips starts a messy turf war between the FBI
and a local sheriff; and a surprising handbook lets us peek into the secret world of professional
cheerleading. Plus: Studs Terkel. "	//hw3.thisamericanlife.org/sites/default/files/imagecache/large_square/episodes/530_lg.jpg	https://hw2.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/530
531	07	25	2014	Got Your Back	"
There is a special comfort that comes from knowing someone's got your back. You can do things that just weren't possible before. You take huge risks, including some that aren't necessarily advisable. This week: stories where one person's powerlessness is transformed when they discover they have backup. And we see what happens when that backup goes away.

532	08	15	2014	Magic Words	"
When Jonathan Goldstein was a kid, his father gave him a book that promised to teach you how to shoot mental laser beams, win the lottery, move solid objects with your mind, make others obey your command – all through the use of mental power and magic words. This week, he revisits the book to try to unlock the secrets within. And we have other stories where people recite words that have the power to change their lives, with no magic or mumbo jumbo at all.

533	09	05	2014	It's Not the Product, It's the Person	"
Starting a business is not for the self-doubting. Or even usually the self-deprecating. The first thing you have to sell is yourself — like dating, but with a greater chance of landing in debt. Alex Blumberg tells the incredible, sweat-stains-and-all saga of a man fumbling through starting a new business, and the man is: himself. Plus, new stories from Mike Birbiglia and Love + Radio.

534	09	12	2014	A Not-So-Simple Majority	"
We take it for granted that the majority calls the shots. But in one NY school district, that idea — majority rules — has led to an all-out war. School board disputes are pretty common, but not like this one. This involves multimillion-dollar land deals, lawyers threatening to beat up parents, felony criminal charges, and the highest levels of state government. Meanwhile, the students are caught in the middle.

536	09	26	2014	The Secret Recordings of Carmen Segarra	"
An unprecedented look inside one of the most powerful, secretive institutions in the country. The NY Federal Reserve is supposed to monitor big banks. But when Carmen Segarra was hired, what she witnessed inside the Fed was so alarming that she got a tiny recorder and started secretly taping. ProPublica's print version.

537	10	03	2014	The Alibi	"
Baltimore, 1999. Hae Min Lee, a bright teenager, disappears after school one day. Six weeks later her ex-boyfriend Adnan Syed is arrested for her murder. He says he's innocent — though he can't remember what he was doing that afternoon. But someone can. A classmate at Woodlawn High School claims to know exactly where Adnan was. Trouble is, she’s nowhere to be found. This week features a pilot of our new podcast, Serial, hosted by Sarah Koenig.

538	10	17	2014	Is This Working?	"
Stories of schools struggling with what to do with misbehaving kids. There's no general agreement about what teachers should do to discipline kids. And there's evidence that some of the most popular punishments actually may harm kids.

539	11	07	2014	The Leap	"
Most of us go from day to day just coasting on the status quo. If it ain’t broke, why fix it, right? But when routines just get too mundane or systems stop making sense, sometimes you just have to hold your breath…and jump. This week, stories of people who leap from their lives, their comfort zones…even through time.

540	11	21	2014	A Front	"
Stories about people and places that are fronting in order to hide the truth. We visit a bizarre store in Milwaukee called Fearless Distributing, government checkpoints scattered on highways out west, and a front in a doctor's office.

541	12	05	2014	Regrets, I've Had a Few	"
Every day we make mistakes, and most of the time we just ignore these failings and move forward. But every so often, there is one that makes us pause and take notice. This week, people struggling with those regrets — big and small — that take root and have to be dealt with.

542	12	12	2014	Wait - Do You Have The Map?	"
Stories about people feeling lost and trying to figure out how to move ahead: two brothers take a doomed road trip through Mexico and a couple from radically different backgrounds draw up a contract for their unlikely romance.

543	12	26	2014	Wake Up Now	"
As New Year’s approaches and people are contemplating things they want to change about themselves, we have stories of people trying to wake themselves up, shake up their own lives, or wake up others. Including the story of a company – or maybe it's a movement – called WakeUpNow.

Can other people's expectations of you alter what you can do physically? Alix Spiegel and Lulu Miller of NPR's new radio show and podcast Invisibilia investigate that question – specifically, they look into something that sounds impossible: if people’s expectations can change whether a blind man can see.

545	01	23	2015	If You Don’t Have Anything Nice to Say, SAY IT IN ALL CAPS	"
It’s safe to say whatever you want on the Internet; nobody will know it’s you. But that same anonymity makes it possible for people to say all the awful things that make the Internet such an annoying and sometimes frightening place. This week: what happens when the Internet turns on you? (If you prefer, here's a bleeped version.)

This American Life host Ira Glass was never into William Burroughs. Didn't get why people love his writing so much. Then he heard this radio story that changed all that, partly because it wasn't very reverential about Burroughs. For Burroughs 101st birthday, we hear that story. If you prefer, here's a bleeped version. "	//hw2.thisamericanlife.org/sites/default/files/imagecache/large_square/episodes/546_lg_0.jpg	https://hw2.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/546
547	02	06	2015	Cops See It Differently, Part One	"
There are so many cops who look at the killing of Eric Garner or Mike Brown and say race didn't play a factor. And there are tons of black people who say that's insane. There's a division between people who distrust the police — even fear them — and people who see cops as a force for good. Stories of people living on both sides of that divide, and people trying to bridge it. (If you prefer, here's a bleeped version.)

548	02	13	2015	Cops See It Differently, Part Two	"
Our second hour of stories about policing and race. We hear about one city where relations between police and black residents went terribly, and another city where they seem to be improving remarkably. And one of our producers asks: Why aren't police chiefs talking about race after incidents where unarmed black men are wrongly killed by officers? (Here is the bleeped version.)

This week, stories of people who are in put into positions they’re completely unqualified to handle … but who try to make it work anyway. Including one story of a tough group of soldiers who attempt to save lives through the power of show tunes.

550	03	13	2015	Three Miles	"
There’s a program that brings together kids from two schools. One school is public and in the country’s poorest congressional district. The other is private and costs $43,000/year. They are three miles apart. The hope is that kids connect, but some of the public school kids just can’t get over the divide. We hear what happens when you get to see the other side and it looks a lot better.

551	03	20	2015	Good Guys 2015	"
Yes fellas, lots of you think of yourselves as good guys. But what does it really take to be a good guy? We have stories of valiant men attempting to do good in challenging and not-so-challenging circumstances: in department stores, public buses, and at the bottom of a cave 900 feet underground.

552	03	27	2015	Need To Know Basis	"
Even when you're not trying to get one over on someone, it can be useful to keep the truth to yourself. Or conversely, to not know why people are lying to your face all the time. This week we'll tell you the whole truth about not telling the whole truth. Including the story of a guy who learned to lie for the first time in his life at age 29.

553	04	03	2015	Stuck In The Middle (2015)	"
Jan Brady is not the only one who hated being in the middle. This week we have stories about how it sucks to be in limbo or be the mediator, but we also hear from a man who absolutely loves being in that uncertain and boring middle most of us dread — on hold, listening to hold music.

554	04	10	2015	Not It!	"
Stories of people, cities, and commonwealths touching their noses and proclaiming ""not it!"" Including the story of how one city used a rocking chair to take retribution against a late night TV show host, and an island that takes people it doesn't want to deal with and ships them away.

555	04	24	2015	The Incredible Rarity of Changing Your Mind	"
It’s rare for people to change what they believe, and if they do it, it’s usually a long process. This week, stories of those very infrequent instances where people’s opinions flip on fundamental things that they believe. Why does it happen in these particular and unusual circumstances? We explain. NOTE: One of the authors of a study covered in this episode has asked that the study be retracted.

556	05	01	2015	Same Bed, Different Dreams	"
Stories of people who are tied together, but imagine radically different futures. In one case, a movie star and her ex-husband plot against Kim Jong-Il. In another, a woman stalks her doppleganger. And sometimes, one bed is the basis for an entire relationship, even for a man who almost never sees the person who shares his bed.

557	05	15	2015	Birds & Bees	"
Some information is so big and so complicated that it seems impossible to talk to kids about. This week, stories about the vague and not-so-vague ways to teach children about race, death and sex - including a story about colleges responding to sexual assault by trying to teach students how to ask for consent. Also, a story about how and when to teach kids about
the horrors of slavery and oppression in America. "	//hw2.thisamericanlife.org/sites/default/files/imagecache/large_square/episodes/557.jpg	https://hw2.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/557
558	05	29	2015	Game Face	"
Blair Braverman was a dog musher on an Alaskan glacier. One day the weather turned rough, and she and a pack of tourists were stuck. The worst part? They had to pretend like nothing was wrong. This and other stories of people facing very difficult situations who put their game face on and muscle through. And, we hear from people whose faces betray them and prominently display all their anxiety.

559	06	26	2015	Captain's Log	"
A captain’s log is a simple thing: the date, the time, maybe the weather — and the current status of a long journey. You wouldn’t know from the cryptic notations what weird worlds lurk beneath. On this week's show, stories behind those cryptic notations — including a concentration camp in China that housed groups of Girl Scouts. Also, Aziz Ansari explains the significance of a Thanksgiving text message, and Etgar Keret destroys a marriage piece by piece.

560	07	03	2015	Abdi and the Golden Ticket	"
A story about someone who's desperately trying – against long odds – to make it to the United States and become an American. Abdi is a Somali refugee living in Kenya and gets the luckiest break of his life: he wins a lottery that puts him on a short list for a U.S. visa. This is his ticket out. But before he can cash in his golden ticket, the police start raiding his neighborhood, targeting refugees.

561	07	17	2015	NUMMI 2015	"
A car plant in Fremont California that might have saved the U.S. car industry. In 1984, General Motors and Toyota opened NUMMI as a joint venture. Toyota showed GM the secrets of its production system: How it made cars of much higher quality and much lower cost than GM achieved. Frank Langfitt explains why GM didn't learn the lessons—until it was too late.

562	07	31	2015	The Problem We All Live With	"
Right now, all sorts of people are trying to rethink and reinvent education, to get poor minority kids performing as well as white kids. But there's one thing nobody tries anymore, despite lots of evidence that it works: desegregation. Nikole Hannah-Jones looks at a district that, not long ago, accidentally launched a desegregation program.

563	08	07	2015	The Problem We All Live With - Part Two	"
Last week we looked at a school district integrating by accident. This week: a city going all out to integrate its schools. Plus, a girl who comes up with her own one-woman integration plan. (Part one.) "	//hw1.thisamericanlife.org/sites/default/files/imagecache/large_square/episodes/563.jpg	https://hw2.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/563
564	08	14	2015	Too Soon?	"
When is too soon for that celebrity comeback; that joke that is either brilliant or full-on repugnant; that parent-child conversation? This week: stories about a fallen man trying to kickstart his career with a reality show, and an awkward moment between a mom and a daughter.

565	08	28	2015	Lower 9 + 10	"
Katrina bus tours go all over New Orleans, but it’s illegal for them to go into the Lower 9th Ward, the area that's been the slowest to rebuild. This week we go around talking to residents there about what matters the most to them (and what doesn't) ten years after the hurricane. The episode we did in 2005 the week of the storm is here.
Pictured: map of Katrina-related fatalities. "	//hw1.thisamericanlife.org/sites/default/files/imagecache/large_square/episodes/565_0.jpg	https://hw2.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/565

567	09	18	2015	What’s Going On In There?	"
Often we see someone’s situation from the outside and think we know exactly what’s going on. This week we get inside and find out just how much more interesting the reality of it is. Including a teenaged girl who records a remarkable story about the boyfriend who abuses her, and why it’s so hard to break up with him. Here are the videos by Bianca Giaever mentioned in the episode.

568	10	02	2015	Human Spectacle 2015	"
Gladiators in the Colosseum. Sideshow performers. Reality television. We've always loved to gawk at the misery or majesty of others. But this week, we ask the question: What's it like when the tables are turned and all eyes are on you?


An episode from last year, with one story swapped. "	//hw1.thisamericanlife.org/sites/default/files/imagecache/large_square/episodes/568_0.jpg	https://hw2.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/568
569	10	09	2015	Put a Bow on It	"
This week we go into the room at the headquarters of fast food chain Hardee's with the people who decided that this burger with beef, hot dogs, and chips is what America should be eating. We'll hear the story of how they sold that burger and other instances where how you tell the story is more important than the literal facts.

570	10	16	2015	The Night In Question	"
Twenty years ago, the prime minister of Israel was assassinated. The killer was a lone gunman, Israeli and Jewish, just like the prime minister. Lots of witnesses saw it happen; the assassin confessed immediately, that night, and has never recanted. But today, oddly, lots of people don’t believe it happened that way. And a question hangs over the country: did this act change the fate of the nation?

572	11	06	2015	Transformers	"
For the New Year, as people everywhere make resolutions, we have stories of people deciding to make very big changes. A prisoner who hasn't talked to anyone in years comes up with a bold plan to re-introduce himself to the world. A 90-year-old woman shocks her family when she falls in love.

573	11	27	2015	Status Update	"
Most of the time, the updates we share about our lives are small and inconsequential. This week, status updates that interrupt daily life. We hear two friends talk about how one of them has become rich and famous. And an entire town gets a status update on itself.

575	12	18	2015	Poetry of Propaganda	"
Sure, there's a crude message that propaganda is trying to get across. But like poetry, when you know how to read it, propaganda contains lots of more subtle messages that you might not see at first glance. This week: examples, big and small, from around the world.

No Christmas can ever be as good as the ones you had as a kid. But this week we go all in and bring the joy, the spontaneity, the sense that anything can happen back to Christmas. We've got a live Christmas performance from some of the best improvisors in the country including Mike Birbiglia, Chris Gethard, and SNL's Aidy Bryant and Sasheer Zamata. Also holiday meals – on fire. "	//hw3.thisamericanlife.org/sites/default/files/imagecache/large_square/episodes/576.jpg	https://hw2.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/576
577	01	15	2016	Something Only I Can See	"
When you’re the only one who can see something, sometimes it feels like you’re in on a special secret. The hard part is getting anyone to believe your secret is real. This week, people trying to show others what they see—including a woman with muscular dystrophy who believes she has the same condition as an Olympic athlete.

At first, it’s super annoying, getting told it’ll make sense when you’re older. Then, when you’re a teenager, hard lessons are learned, despite your best efforts to be too cool to care. By the time you’re actually old, you know a bunch of stuff— and you’re desperate to hold onto it. You might even wonder HOW you know all the things you know.

Exactly how incompetent you are. What your ex’s best friend really thinks of you. The approximate time that you will die. Some things in life are better not to know about. And sometimes there can be a benefit to not knowing. In this episode, examples of ignorance truly being bliss, or even being an asset.

It’s nice to belong, to feel connected to others. But what happens when you realize that your fundamental beliefs don’t line up with the people you want to be close to? Do you bring it up?

587	05	27	2016	The Perils of Intimacy	"
Stories about mysteries that exist in relationships we thought couldn't possibly surprise us, and the strangeness of putting our wants on the line with someone who may not share them at all-- and how much we're willing to risk for someone we may never see again.

589	06	17	2016	Tell Me I’m Fat	"
The way people talk about being fat is shifting. With one-third of Americans classified as overweight, and another third as obese, and almost none of us losing weight and keeping it off, maybe it’s time to rethink the way we see being fat. A show inspired by Lindy West’s book Shrill. "	//hw2.thisamericanlife.org/sites/default/files/imagecache/large_square/episodes/589c.jpg	https://hw2.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/589

A bunch of us from our show went to refugee camps all over Greece. We found people falling in love, kids mad at their parents for dragging them to Europe, women doing their laundry in a baseball stadium locker room, and hundreds of people living at a gas station—sitting next to the pumps, smoking. Also: wild pigs. 57,000 refugees are stuck in Greece, making homes in some surprising locations. We hear what that’s really like."	//hw4.thisamericanlife.org/sites/default/files/imagecache/large_square/episodes/greece-refugees-4.png	https://hw2.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/592

We return to Greece with stories of people trying to move on with their lives in whatever way they can. We meet a couple who fell in love even though they weren't expecting anything like that to happen, and even though her family didn't approve. We also meet a shopkeeper in a camp who's running what amounts to a cigarette charity."	//hw1.thisamericanlife.org/sites/default/files/imagecache/large_square/episodes/583-th.jpg	https://hw2.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/593

What do you do when you're thrown into a situation you’re not prepared for? And while you’re flailing around—what happens to the people who depend on you? This week we present stories of people who find themselves in over their heads, including an attorney who knows little about criminal law assigned to defend a young man facing twenty years in prison.

607	01	06	2017	Didn’t We Solve This One?	"
We’ve fought two wars since 9/11. We got help from tens of thousands of Iraqis and Afghans—some were targeted or killed because they helped us. We owe these people. We’ve passed laws that say so. So why has it been so hard for us to get many of them to safety?

609	02	03	2017	It’s Working Out Very Nicely	"
This week we document what happened when the President’s executive order went into effect temporarily banning travel from seven countries, and we talk about the way it was implemented. A major policy change thrown into the world like a fastball with no warning. It’s hard not to ask: “What just happened? What was that all about?”

614	04	14	2017	The Other Mr. President	"
Since Russia meddled in our election, there's been concern that the fake news and disinformation that's so prevalent there could be taking hold in this country. But is that hyperbole? This week we look at what it's actually like to live in the confusing information landscape that is Putin's Russia.

615	04	28	2017	The Beginning of Now	"
Before Donald Trump started his presidential campaign in 2015, there was a congressional race that redefined what was possible in American politics. Steve Bannon and Breitbart News got involved in that race early, just like they later got deeply involved in Donald Trump's race. On this week’s show: What happened in that campaign, what it made it work, and how we got to now.

619	06	30	2017	The Magic Show	"
Just a few years before he got the internship at NPR that started him in radio, our host Ira Glass had another career. He performed magic at children's birthday parties. A powerful sense of embarrassment has prevented him from ever doing an episode on the subject, but when he learned that producer David Kestenbaum was also a kid conjurer, they decided to dive in together.

620	07	14	2017	To Be Real	"
Most of the time, we show the world a pretty superficial version of ourselves. ""How about that weather?"" But this week—people who try to go deeper, to get to something real, in some unexpected places: war, magic and porn.

621	07	21	2017	Fear and Loathing in Homer and Rockville	"
Two towns where people got really upset about undocumented immigrants, even though in both places, that did not seem to be the most important thing happening at all. One of the towns, a small town in Alaska, has no undocumented immigrants at all, but the possibility of them arriving put the whole town at each other’s throats.

623	08	18	2017	We Are in the Future	"
One of our producers, Neil Drumming, has recently become fascinated with Afrofuturism. It's more than sci-fi. It’s a way of looking at black culture that’s fantastic, creative, and oddly hopeful—which feels especially urgent during a time without a lot of optimism.
